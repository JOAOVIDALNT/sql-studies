# Exact numbers

- There are two basic classes of exact numeric data types - Integer, and Fixed Precision and Scale

> Integer Data Types
> - bit
> - tinyint
> - smallint
> - int
> - bigint

> Fixed Precision and Scale Data Types
> - numeric
> - decimal
> - smallmoney
> - money

These data types are useful for representing numbers exactly. As long as the values can fit within the range of the values storable in the data type, the value will not have rounding issues. This is useful for any financial calculations, where rounding errors will result in clinical insanity for accountants.
